# CourseraGettingandCleaningData
#This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera.
# The code run_analysis.R will do the following:
# 1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# 2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
# 3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
# 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
# 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independednt tidy data set wiht the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
# 
# The data set "UCI HAR Dataset" is downloaded from the Assignments page in the Getting and Cleaning Data course, which was obtained from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

# The code book contains the variables used in this code and their descriptions.
